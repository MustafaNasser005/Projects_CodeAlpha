   - Sepal Width (0.0 - 10.0 cm)
   - Petal Length (0.0 - 10.0 cm)
   - Petal Width (0.0 - 10.0 cm)

2. **Learn About Random Forest**: Explore the algorithm details and how it works

3. **Predict**: Click the "🔮 Predict Species" button

4. **View Results**: See the predicted species and simulated confidence scores

### Model Information

- **Educational Content**: Understand how ensemble methods work and why they're effective
- **Algorithm Explanation**: Step-by-step breakdown of how Random Forest makes predictions

## 📈 Dataset Information

The famous Iris dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features:

| Feature | Description | Range |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Sepal Length | Length of the sepal in cm | 4.3 - 7.9 |
| Sepal Width | Width of the sepal in cm | 2.0 - 4.4 |
| Petal Length | Length of the petal in cm | 1.0 - 6.9 |
| Petal Width | Width of the petal in cm | 0.1 - 2.5 |

### Species Classes
- **Iris-setosa**: 50 samples
- **Iris-versicolor**: 50 samples  
- **Iris-virginica**: 50 samples

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing

### Demo Mode
This application runs in demo mode with:
- **Rule-based Prediction**: Simple classification based on petal length
- **Simulated Probabilities**: Demo confidence scores
- **Random Forest Focus**: Learn about ensemble learning and Random Forest algorithm
- **Educational Content**: Understand ML concepts without requiring trained models

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**
   - Make sure dependencies are installed: `pip install streamlit pandas numpy`
   - Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)

2. **Port already in use**
   - Streamlit will automatically find an available port
   - Or specify a different port: `streamlit run app/app.py --server.port 8502`

3. **Image not displaying**
   - Add an iris flower image named `iris-machinelearning.png` to the project root
   - The app will show a large flower emoji placeholder if no image is found

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the terminal/command prompt for error messages
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
3. Verify you're running the command from the correct directory
